A simple Python-based color-targeting aimbot using real-time screen capture and mouse control.

Detects green targets on screen using HSV color filtering and contours.

Locks the mouse cursor directly onto the closest target with pixel-perfect accuracy.

It doesnt trace moving objects that good but you can edit the code itself to make it better ^_^
